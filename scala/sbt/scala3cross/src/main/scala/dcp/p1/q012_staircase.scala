// There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
//
//For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
//
//1, 1, 1, 1
//2, 1, 1
//1, 2, 1
//1, 1, 2
//2, 2
