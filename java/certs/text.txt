trustStore is to verify credentials - stores certificates from third party, your Java application communicate or certificates signed by CA which can be used to identify third party.
keyStore is to provide credential - stores private key and certificates corresponding to their public keys and require if you are SSL Server or SSL requires client authentication

trustStore is used by TrustManager and keyStore is used by KeyManager.
TrustManager determines whether remote connection should be trusted or not i.e. whether remote party is who it claims to.
KeyManager decides which authentication credentials should be sent to the remote host for authentication during SSL handshake.

if you are an SSL Server you will use private key during key exchange algorithm and send certificates corresponding to your public keys to client, this certificate is acquired from keyStore.
On SSL client side, if its written in Java, it will use certificates stored in trustStore to verify identity of Server. 

For example, using SSL, the server computes a value and encrypts the value using its private key. The encrypted value is called a digital signature. The client decrypts the encrypted value using the server’s public key and compares the value to its own computed value. If the two values match, the client can trust that the signature is authentic, because only the private key could have been used to produce such a signature.

1.Generate the server certificate.
keytool -genkey -alias server-alias -keyalg RSA -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -keystore keystore.jks

2.Export the generated server certificate in keystore.jks into the file server.cer.
keytool -export -alias server-alias -storepass changeit -file server.cer -keystore keystore.jks

3. To create the truststore file cacerts.jks and add the server certificate to the truststore:
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias server-alias -file server.cer -keystore cacerts.jks -keypass changeit -storepass changeit
