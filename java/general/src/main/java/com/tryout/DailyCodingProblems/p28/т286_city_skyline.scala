//The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly
// overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an
// array of (left, right, height) tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building
// begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of (x, height) tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each new height.
//
//Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.
//
//For example, suppose the input consists of the buildings [(0, 15, 3), (4, 11, 5), (19, 23, 4)].
// In aggregate, these buildings would create a skyline that looks like the one below.
//
//     ______
//    |      |        ___
// ___|      |___    |   |
//|   |   B  |   |   | C |
//| A |      | A |   |   |
//|   |      |   |   |   |
//------------------------
//As a result, your function should return [(0, 3), (4, 5), (11, 3), (15, 0), (19, 4), (23, 0)].
