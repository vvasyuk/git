// Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.
//
//We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:
//
//The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
//All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (,,;,:) or terminal marks (.,?,!,â€½).
//There must be a single space between each word.
//The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.
