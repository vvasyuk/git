    //We can do better by taking advantage of the almost-sorted property. Specifically,
    //after we have read k +1numbers, the smallest number in that group must be smaller
    //than all following numbers. For the given example, after we have read the first 3
    //numbers, 3,-1, 2, the smallest, -1, must be globally the smallest. This is because the
    //sequence was specified to have the property that number is at index 0 in sorted order.
    //    //After we read in the 4, the second s every number is at most 2 away
    //from its final sorted location and the smallestmallest number must be the minimum of 3, 2, 4,
    //i.e., 2.
    //To solve this problem in the general setting, we need to store k +1 numbers and
    //want to be able to efficiently extract the minimum number and add a new number. A
    //min-heap is exactly what we need. We add the first k numbers to a min-heap. Now,
    //we add additional numbers to the min-heap and extract the minimum from the heap.
