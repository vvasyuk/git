// A string is said to be an arithmetical expression in Reverse Polish notation (RPN) if:
// 1) It is a single digit or a sequence of digits, prefixed with an option -, e.g., "6", "123", "-42".
// 2) It is of the formâ€œA,B,o" where A and B are RPN expressions and o is one of +,-,x,/
//For example, the following strings satisfy these rules: "1729", "3,4, +,2,x,1, +", "1,1, +,-2, x", "-641,6, /, 28, /".
//An RPN expression can be evaluated uniquely to an integer, which is determined
//recursively. The base case corresponds to Rule (1.), which is an integer expressed in
//base-10 positional system. Rule (2.)corresponds to the recursive case, and the RPNs
//are evaluated in the natural way, e.g., if A evaluates to 2 and B evaluates to 3, then
//"A,B,x" evaluates to 6.

    //record 3, then 4, then applying the + to 3 and 4, and record the result, 7. Note that
    //we never need to examine the 3 and 4 again. Next we multiply by 2, and record the
    //result, 14. Finally, we add 1 to obtain the final result, 15.
    //Observe that we need to record partial results, and as we encounter operators,
    //we apply them to the partial results. The partial results are added and removed in
    //last-in, first-out order, which makes a stack the natural data structure for evaluating
