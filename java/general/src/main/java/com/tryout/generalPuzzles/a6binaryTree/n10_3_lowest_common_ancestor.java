// Any two nodes in a binary tree have a common ancestor, namely the root. The lowest
//common ancestor (LCA) of any two nodes in a binary tree is the node furthest from
//the root that is an ancestor of both nodes

//calculation when rendering web pages, specifically when computing the Cascading
//Style Sheet (CSS) that is applicable to a particular Document Object Model (DOM)

    //how many of the two nodes were present in that subtree, and the second is their LCA,
