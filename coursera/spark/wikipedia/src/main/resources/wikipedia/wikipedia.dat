Its syntax and general usage directly overlaps with that of the interpreted [[Rebol]] language (which was introduced in 1997).  Yet the implementation choices of Red were geared specifically to overcoming limitations of Rebol, creating what Rakocevic calls a "full stack programming language".  Red can be used for extremely high-level programming ([[Domain-specific language|DSL]]s and [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]s) as well as low-level programming ([[operating system]]s and [[device driver]]s).  Key to the approach is that the language has two parts: ''Red/System'' and ''Red''.  The former (Red/System) is similar to C, but packaged into a Rebol lexical structure ''(e.g. one would write "if x > y [print {Hello}]" instead of "if (x > y) {printf("Hello\n");}")''.  Red itself is a [[Homoiconicity|homoiconic language]] capable of meta-programming, whose semantics are more similar to Rebol's.  Its runtime library is written in Red/System, and uses a hybrid approach: it [[Compiled language|compiles]] what it can deduce statically, has a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]] for cases that can make use of it, and falls back onto an embedded [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] when neither of those approaches will suffice.  Red seeks to remain independent of any other toolchain, and thus does its own code generation.  It's therefore possible to [[Cross compiler|cross-compile]] Red programs from any platform it supports to any other, via a command-line switch.  Both Red and Red/System are distributed as [[open-source software]] under the [[BSD licenses#3-clause license .28.22New BSD License.22 or .22Modified BSD License.22.29|modified BSD license]].  The runtime library is distributed under the more permissive [[Boost Software License]].  ==Language schema== [[File:Red architecture small.PNG]]  ==Introduction==  The Red programming language was presented during the [[Software Freedom Day]] 2011<ref name="sfd">[http://www.softwarefreedomday.eu/2011/Red.html « Red »], ''softwarefreedomday.eu'', september 14, 2011.</ref>{{;}}<ref>[http://www.red-lang.org/2011/09/red-at-software-freedom-day-2011.html « Red Programming Language: Red at Software Freedom Day 2011 »], ''red-lang.org'', september 14, 2011.</ref> giving to its author a large audience; the video is still on the SFD homepage since September 2011. Rakocevic is also the joint winners of the Rebol of the Year 2011 election.<ref>[http://devcon.esperconsultancy.nl/ « Red & Rebol DevCon Winter 2012 »], ''devcon'', winter 2012.</ref> Red was first introduced in the [[Netherlands]] on February 2011 at the ''Rebol & Boron conference''<ref>[http://www.osnews.com/story/24798/New_Red_Programming_Language_Gets_Syllable_Backend « New Red Programming Language Gets Syllable Backend »], ''osnews.com'', May 2011.</ref> by its author, who is also known to be the creator of the Cheyenne [[HTTP server]].<ref>[http://development.syllable.org/news/2011-05-28-00-37-First-Red-program-on-SyllableDesktop.html « Red Alert! »], ''syllable.org'', May 2011.</ref> ==Features== Red's syntax and semantics is very close to those of [[Rebol]]. Like Rebol, it strongly supports [[metaprogramming]] ([[Domain specific language|DSL]]) and is therefore a highly efficient tool for dialecting. Red/System, which provides system programming facilities also supports some concurrent programming features like task and data parallelism. Red is easily in embeddable ("''Think Lua''") and very lightweight (not more than a megabyte). It is also able to cross-compile to various platforms (see Cross Compilation section below) as well as creating packages (like .APK packages on Android) for some platforms (currently, Android is the only platform supported but development is still in process) via bridges intended for implementation of Red on the former (like Java (JVM), .NET, JavaScript etc.).  ==Goals== The following is the list of Red's Goals as presented on the [[Software Freedom Day]] 2011:  * Simplicity ("An IDE should not be necessary to write code.") * Compactness ("Being highly expressive maximizes productivity.") * Speed ("If too slow, it cannot be general-purpose enough.") * Be "Green", Have a Small Footprint ("Because resources are not limitless.") * Ubiquity ("Spread everywhere.") * Portability, Write once run everywhere ("That’s the least expected from a programming language.") * Flexibility ("Not best but good fit for any task!")  ==Development== Red's development is planned to be done in two phases: # Initial phase : Red and Red/System compilers written in [[Rebol]] # [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|Bootstrap]] phase : Red/System compiler, Red compiler, Red JIT-compiler rewritten in Red.  ==Cross compilation== Red currently supports the following cross-compilation targets :  <small>(Note: This list will increase with time and should therefore be considered as incomplete.)</small> * [[MS-DOS]] : Windows, [[x86]], console (and GUI) applications * [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] : Windows, x86, GUI applications * [[Linux]]: [[GNU/Linux]], x86 * Linux-ARM : [[GNU/Linux]], [[ARM architecture| ARMv5]], [[ARM architecture|armel]] (soft-float) * [[Raspberry Pi]] : [[GNU/Linux]], [[ARM architecture| ARMv5]], [[armhf]] (hard-float) * [[FreeBSD]] : [[x86]] * [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] : [[OS X]] Intel, console-only applications * [[Syllable Desktop|Syllable]] : [[Syllable Desktop|Syllable OS]], [[x86]] * [[Android (operating system)|Android]] : Android, [[ARM architecture|ARMv5]] * Android-x86 : Android, [[x86]]  ==Hello World!== <source lang="rebol"> Red [   Title: "Simple hello world script" ] print "Hello World!" </source>  ==Factorial Example== The following is a factorial example in Red : <source lang="rebol"> Red [Title: "A factorial script"]        ; Note: The title is optional.  factorial: func [   x [integer!]                         ; Giving the type of an argument in Red is optional ][   either x = 0 [1][x * factorial x - 1] ] </source> The following is the same factorial example in Red/System (in this very simple case, the source code is very similar to Red's version) : <source lang="rebol"> Red/System [Title: "A factorial script"]  factorial: func [  x       [integer!]                   ; This is compulsory in Red/System   return: [integer!]                   ; This is compulsory in Red/System ][  either x = 0 [1][x * factorial x - 1] ] </source>  ==See also== * [[Rebol]] ==References== {{Reflist}}  == External links == * [https://github.com/red/red Source code] on [[GitHub]].

Can someone please explain? thanks. [[User:Gil mo|Gil_mo]] ([[User talk:Gil mo|talk]]) 06:27, 28 June 2012 (UTC) :It depends on the constraints. From my POV, I would say that the worst constraint would be to keep the number of characters to a certain length. If you allow for a larger number of characters in the password, and you don't have a ridiculous constraint like "you can only use the letter x as your password, and your password can be only between 100 to 105 characters long" then this would help with password strength. - [[User:Letsbefiends|Letsbefiends]] ([[User talk:Letsbefiends|talk]]) 06:37, 28 June 2012 (UTC) ::Yes, the obvious requirement for "at least one ...." and "at least six characters" is designed to increase password strength (for those people who use "me" or "password" or just a word from the dictionary), but I'm surprised that so many sites (and "Windows"), limit the number of characters.  I often have to truncate the longer passwords I use.

How do you know that the backend programmer did not assume, for the entirety of his code, that the password is a valid length, and that a long password would make it behave incorrectly?

[[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 11:09, 28 June 2012 (UTC)  :The issue in question is whether the password can be tackled via a [[brute force attack]]. What you're really trying to do is add entropy to the system — more possibilities for passwords — to overwhelm a brute force attack. Of all of them, though, length is probably the most important, and [http://xkcd.com/936/ it has been] noted in many cases that trying to artificially add entropy by requiring numbers, capitals, etc., often ends up with passwords that are hard for the individual user to remember that aren't actually very hard to crack. They also lead to high amounts of password reuse across systems (in which case the weakest link compromises all log-ins) and can lead to other unsafe practices like writing the password down on sticky notes attached to their monitor. I've personally been quite irritated with sites that purport to care a lot about security (a bank I once belonged to, for example) requiring extremely short but unintuitive passwords (maximum length of 8 or something like that), when I personally prefer using passphrases (short sentences usually taken at random from a book I have around here) for their ease of remembering plus length. --[[User:Mr.98|Mr.98]] ([[User talk:Mr.98|talk]]) 11:24, 28 June 2012 (UTC)  :I am no expert so forgive my musings on this matter. Restrictions seem to come from an understanding that the more "tricks" included, the less easy it is to crack the code. We all know that this might not actually work, but it's a good place to start. If you allow a user free reign they might just use "password" or "wikipedia123". If you constrain them to 6 characters they might use "passwo" as much as they might use "XyU4*M".

Or, as one guy I worked with did, he made almost every password he used "nameofthesite1!" Which isn't such a bad password unless you figure out the system. People have bad security practices. Remember that you're not really trying to fool actual people — you're trying to fool computers by making it so that instead of just having to check aaa, aab, aac, aad, and so on, they also have to check aab1, aab2, aab3. It superficially seems like adding numbers and capitals and symbols would add so much extra effort that it would be impossible, but computers can check thousands and thousands of passwords per seconds on poorly secured systems. (On hash cracking—where a hacker had downloaded a poorly encrypted list of passwords from a website, as occasionally happens even with major sites—[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/speed-hashing.html clever programs] can allow even just off-the-shelf computers to crack ''billions'' of hashes per second. Which means that all 6 letter passwords, even with capitals and numbers, can be cracked in ''under a minute'', and 7 letters in about an hour.)  Adding length drastically increases the amount of "work" necessary, much more so than requiring capitals and numbers and all that. --[[User:Mr.98|Mr.98]] ([[User talk:Mr.98|talk]]) 12:00, 28 June 2012 (UTC)  :[http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/12/13/the-top-50-gawker-media-passwords/ Here's a WSJ blog post] about the most popular passwords on the Gawker Media websites, a piece of data revealed when somebody simply stole the whole password file (architected by someone who was not a security expert, apparently) and posted it somewhere.  The passwords like "12345678" are reflections of the requirement that passwords be at least 8 characters long.  People presumably use these easy-to-remember passwords for sites like Gawker, where the user doesn't care at all if someone steals the password, as opposed to their bank passwords.

Specifically, it looked like something directly in-between "áa" and "aá." Middle instead of left or right. Is there any way to replicate this in, e.g., a forum post? I can't find anything in Unicode that could permit this. Not a single character for "aa" (like there is for "ae") or an in-between combining diacritic. Obviously, the dictionary writers had to have typeset it somehow, and computers were probably involved... but is there any way for ''me'' to replicate it? --[[User:Shay Guy|Shay Guy]] ([[User talk:Shay Guy|talk]]) 22:15, 28 June 2012 (UTC) :A "forum post" makes things a lot more tricky.  [[Kerning]] and [[typesetting]] depend on the font, application, operating system, and loads of other factors; so even if you ''found'' an appropriate set of standard unicode [[letter-spacing]] marks and an acceptable [[diacritic]] mark, it's nearly impossible to guarantee that the glyphs on ''your'' screen are similar at all to the glyphs on ''my'' screen, let alone anyone else's.  Here's a place to start: [[Phonetic_symbols_in_Unicode#Spacing_Modifier_Letters_.28U.2B02B0.E2.80.9302FF.29|Unicode phonetic symbols - spacing modifier letters]], and [[combining character]] marks.  Again, let me stress this strongly - there are about 900 million Unicode-standard-compliant ways to ''exactly'' specify the kerning you want with combining-characters and diacritics and letter glyphs, but that ''does not mean'' that people will see the correct rendering (or anything at all) on their screens.  If you ''must'' have pixel-accurate glyphs, you need to use a graphical typesetter and [[rasterize]] a bitmapped image of the typeset text. :As an example, here's a unicode "a", followed by a combined diacritic, followed by another unicode "a."   a̛a (in hex, a four-byte sequence <tt>0x61 0xCC 0x9B 0x61</tt>), which renders as two glyphs, plus an accent mark glyph, in Firefox on my operating system, reading those as UTF-8. :Here is a nice reference for many [http://www.user.uni-hannover.de/nhtcapri/combining-marks.html combining marks and precomposed equivalents].

A very simple solution I've got for this would be some hidden categories that could be placed on articles or their talk pages to help identify articles by the language of their references.

The current legislation.gov.uk site does not meet the requirement as it only holds legislation still in force, and seemingly not information about historical repeals.  With this in mind it would be appreciated if you were able to respond to the following questions (under Freedom of Information provisons)  i) Does your orgainsation in fact retain a list of the titles (in specific Short Titles) and Chapter Numbers for all UK primary legislation? (In print this dataset would be the 'Chronological Table of The Statutes')  ii) If held, (or can be provided) what period (specifically which Monarchs) this dataset covers, and when it was last revised?  iii) If held,(or can be provided) the likely time-scale needed to provide this data in a 'machine-readable' format, licensed subject to Open Government License terms the intent being to confirm and supplement data already held within Wikipedia and Wikisource.  iv) If not held,  which organisation or official publication contains a partial version of the data being sought, and under what restrictions such data-set or publication can be provided?"

So, for example, if I came from (Centenary), I would only get the centenary redirect hatnote.  The user interface could be simple - basically, there would be a certain class of hatnote templates that is dynamic. In the template, you specify all of the redirects that you want the hatnote to be triggered by. The software would normalize, (so you don't have to specify "Centuries" and "centuries" etc) by decapitalizing, removing spaces, and converting accents to ascii for example - that way, if new redirects get added, they might still trigger the hatnote.--[[User:Karl.brown|KarlB]] ([[User talk:Karl.brown|talk]]) 02:57, 4 May 2012 (UTC)  :Oooh, great idea! --[[Special:Contributions/76.69.138.105|76.69.138.105]] ([[User talk:76.69.138.105|talk]]) 06:00, 6 May 2012 (UTC) : Yes, that would be great for redirects.

There have been several, piecemeal discussions in recent weeks about ITN, the general theme being whether it is too focussed on things which are general news, and not enough on stand-alone, consequential, encyclopaedic events. In my judgement, there is a significant strand of opinion that we should go all-out to move towards the latter, but at the same time there is a legitimate resistance to removing the only true avenue to the Main Page that "highly significant yet routine" news events have.   So I've been thinking about how we could possibly marry these two seemingly conflicting wishes. And I think a possible solution might be to use the TFL slot, which currently only runs on Mondays, to when appropriate feature "Today's topical article". This would be a reasonably well-developed article (C Class due to relatively minor deficiencies at an absolute minimum, ideally B class, GA or FA), on an article which under the current ITN system would ordinarily get a blurb. The existence of this section &ndash; which I envisage would only be used on 50-80% of the available days, due to the availability of stories and quality of articles &ndash; would enable us to steer ITN firmly in the direction of covering major, encyclopaedic events, rather than simply things which we consider important enough. I envisage that the overriding factor would simply be quality of article: where the supply of stories exceeds space it should simply be a race to the top, and a consensus decision on which is the higher quality article. If there is not an article which is at the very least close to B-class quality, we do not run an article at all on that day.   Thoughts? —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  15:11, 11 May 2012 (UTC)  Addendum: For clarity, I am not proposing that we replace TFL (I am after all one of its biggest proponents). The suggestion is that this idea might utilise the TFL slot on the days that TFL doesn't run. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  16:23, 11 May 2012 (UTC)  :So, what would replace the position currently occupied by ITN? -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 16:02, 11 May 2012 (UTC) ::Nothing. ITN would remain, albeit it would probably shift significantly towards "major recent events" (things outside of the usual news cycle), and away from "general news".<p>Essentially, the message to those who want to get something related to "general news" onto the Main Page would be to work on the article, and if it's of high enough quality, the article will be rewarded with high-quality exposure &ndash; a full-on TFA/TFL style blurb about the subject, in which the news itself is mentioned but is not the sole purpose of the blurb. I'm tentatively suggesting that quality be the only consideration (provided a subject is in the news), to prevent relatively subjective discussions about whether a particular piece of news is important enough. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  16:17, 11 May 2012 (UTC) :I was musing a somwhat similar idea last night but didn't actually raise it anywhere.  Instead of a running order of teasers in the ITN box use an extended extract from just one story, replaced as and when a new story comes along that is ready.  It might help alleviate the staleness problem we've had recently and at the same time it would implicitly enforce the update requirement more strongly - after all any extract is going to focus on the updated element even if it is part of the wider article so obviously a one-sentence non-update doesn't fit the bill.  However, in some situations some editorialising would be needed to put the updated content into context - that isn't a show-stopper but is more work somewhere along the line. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 16:39, 11 May 2012 (UTC).  This is a very interesting idea. It's been stressed repeatedly that ITN is not a venue to simply ''report the news''. Its underlying mission is still to showcase articles on this encyclopedia (and, to add to that, to have a convenient place where people can click on things they are interested in, in a timely and accessible fashion). This proposal would incentivize editors to contribute to articles detailing recent events much the same way DYK incentivizes creation of new articles. I envision that a 'queue' is drawn up and articles are placed on the main page after they undergo some scrutiny from the community (C-class minimum is a good standard, but also sufficient updates and a reference check).  I would also like to put forth the idea of '''ditching the ITN blurb''' (I don't understand everything Main-Page has to be a blurb!), or at least reducing its use. This way, it could save the discussions and arguments over blurb nuance, allow for a greater number of articles to be posted at any given time, and also prevent the blurb from featuring only ''a segment'' of the article that may only be of cursory importance. For example, the recent Greek elections: we posted a relatively inconsequential detail (who won a plurality) when we could wait until the dust settles to post who actually ''formed government''. Doing away with the blurb would solve this problem: the reader would simply click and read the article itself (which is what we want the reader to do anyway).  Another reason for this is so we can showcase articles that are well updated but often get bogged down in 'support-oppose' style discussions at ITN/C, such as the NCAA March Madness debate that has now become an "annual ITN tradition". Effectively we can have a topical section on sports, in which we can provide links to the recent sporting events of wide interest. The NCAA guys would be happy that their article gets posted on the main page (they dedicate ''a lot'' of time updating it meticulously), and the community wouldn't be so put off that it is taking an entire blurb space on the page. Plus the reader benefits.  Yet another reason to have a 'topical article' idea is that it would incentivize updates to "minority topic" articles. Let's say we have five topics, just for starters: sports, disasters, politics, business and science. Let's say each topic showcases three articles dealing with recent events at any given time. We know that politics articles update more often, therefore are more likely to get 'recycled' off of the page more often. Science articles have higher lag time (as of now), so a user creating an article or updating an article about a recent event in the science category would understand that the science article will stick longer on the main page. Therefore for a veteran contributor, he might choose to contribute to science articles over a politics article just so his work can appear on the main page for a longer time (perhaps this will even out the "minority topics coverage" over time). To add onto that, to curb systemic bias, some incentive can also be given for users to create articles that deal with undercovered areas. <P>Anyway, I am optimistic that we all have the same goals in mind, and I am glad someone proposed a bold, fresh, thought-provoking idea!

As they said;  <blockquote><b>I now suggest that wikipedia have a campaign to teach editors that TIME is very important in editing.<br /><br />In articles I often come across references to things such as "recent" "current" "currently" "last few years" "last few decades" "last century" etc. These are obviously silly and have no place in an encyclopedia.<br /><br />So. 1. editors need to be made aware NOT to use such phrases 2 Someone should make a robot which searches for phrases like this and flags them as POSSIBLE TIME PROBLEMS</b></blockquote>  What is the feasibility of such a bot being developed?  There are evident advantages to a bot. It will assist in dealing with actual in line content rather than focusing upon whole pages. It should be able to highlight pages with multiple issues and priorities them and assist in targeting copy editors to the most needy cases. It would act to target experienced eyes and minds where they can be most valuable, and they are also most likely to pick up multiple issues.   Of course the idea may be totally infeasible for wiki, but I would prefer that to be shown to be the case rather than it being assumed to be the case. It could be a great bot and tool is lost for the want of a nail.

For example, in direct quotes these types of phrases should not be tagged. And in a phrase such as "In the last few years of the 20th century", "last few years" is entirely clear. The word "current" has many different meanings (see all sections besides the first of [[current (disambiguation)]]), and words such as "current", "recent", and "currently" may not be a problem when discussing events on a [[geological time scale]]. : Your best bet would be to have someone periodically analyze a [[WP:DD|database dump]] to generate a list of articles for humans to manually go through; I'm not sure whether this is in the ambit of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Check Wikipedia]], or whether they focus more on technical and syntactic issues rather than semantic issues. [[User:Anomie|Anomie]][[User talk:Anomie|⚔]] 15:02, 19 May 2012 (UTC) ::Thanks for the response [[User:Anomie|Anomie]] - it would seem that the use of the term Bot is misleading. It would seem that "Tool" or maybe "Script" is a better description. Thanks for helping focus the language.<br /><br />I have anticipated the argument that "Quotations" would be an issue. It is relatively simple when content is parsed to ignore everything within quotation marks.<br /><br />I don't believe that using a Database dump is useful or practical. It takes the focus away from wiki itself and the edit window. A correctly formatted tool/script along the lines of a Java script that keeps focus where it is needed.<br /><br />Headings such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_currently_active_military_vehicles Category:Lists_of_currently_active_military_vehicles] show just how mixed up the language is. On the page there are many forms of Cron Language from "Active" to "Currently Active". Does "Currently Active" mean an aircraft has to be in the air to count? The recognised phrase would be "In Service", but it does not feature at all. "In Service" is itself Cron Language. Any tool would need to link certain words and phrases for searching such as "Military"+"Active"or"Currently" to parse down to pages that need the eyes of copy editors.<br /><br />I would advise looking for the following using the wiki search engine "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%22currently+airing%22 | currently airing]". Does it identify pages that are about the subject, or is it identifying pages that have an air of advertising and marketing about them that may need some attention?<br /><br />The Guild of copy editors are themselves focusing upon Cron Language [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Guild_of_Copy_Editors/Projects#Turn_of_the_century|Turn Of The Century]]<br /><br />The word "presently" keeps cropping up. I found one entry that caught my eye concerning a rather rare and precious gem which is described as "Presently" being in [[Darya-ye_Noor|The Iranian Crown Jewels]]. I did not know that one of the world's rarest gems is for sale! Who do I pay? P^) <br /><br />Presently, as adverb, is not being used correctly. The entry should be in the simple present tense, denoting a fact that continues into the future. The English language has no True Future Tense, other tenses are modified to talk about the future. Here we have an unintended time shift that indiactes I can buy a rather nice gem. My guess is it is linked to a translation issue.<br /><br />I have noticed: ::* that when you find Cron language, it has a high incidence on pages that are already tagged with other issues.<br /> ::* that on many of these pages the language in general indicates that it has been translated into English, or the person who has written the page is not First Language English. Other languages have very different tense structures to English, and unskilled direct translation often introduces Cron Language in error.  ::*Frequently, linked citations are either wrong or incorrectly formatted or both.    ::* Cron Language keeps on cropping up on pages that have a very high level of edits identified only by IP address and where there are observable issues over COI. When you check the IP you find it linked to those with clear COI. ::* There are templates to deal with specific date and cron issues [[Template:Update_after|Update After]] and [[WP:ASOF]], and that shows just how important Time is to referencing and validity of content.   ::I did a quick test with google and looked for pages with the template for "additional citations" which produced over 600,000. I double checked that for just the word "Presently" and got over 180000 results.<br /><br />I then checked for copy edit template and found 3500. Cross reference that with "Presently and you get 1800 hits. It would seem that when copy editing is identified as a need it has a better correlation with overall issues and clean up. And that is just looking at one term in the pantheon of "Cron Language".<br /><br />I'm no copy editor. My eyes and mind work in different ways, but I can see just how those eyes and minds can be better utilised and empowered. I also see that there is little information available on how to use existing resources to locate issues within wiki that copy editors are experts in fixing. Catscan is one resource but it does not allow the needed analysis. Any tool may need to reference a specialist tag which would identify that a page has been copy edited and not changed since. It could be referenced to the talk page so that an entry there saying that phrase "Blah Blah" was reviewed and passed (date) would exclude the wiki page entry from any generated lists. That way if a new edit has introduced new or further Cron language it can be readily flagged for a revisit, review and re-tagged. It would allow the copy editors to do Quick Jobs easily rather than having a massive focus upon in depth copy editing. There is also wider application for hunting down and addressing many other forms of language - "Purported" gets some interesting results. Purported by who - when - how? Where did the allegation, inference or claim come from? It flags up so many missing citations it's fascinating.<br /><br />Presently, when you look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit Wikipedia articles needing copy edit] it is clear that articles with high levels of needed input have been tagged. The smaller issues which are equally important and even rapidly addressed are being missed. There are presently no tools to empower the copy editors to locate and address the far larger incidence of Cron Language misuse - and which can be dealt with faster. Using the wiki search engine just returns list of pages that is hard to manage - and if a piece of Cron language is found to be valid, it still keeps being pulled up even after it has been addressed.<br /><br />A valid tool or script that empowers people to track down Cron Language - and potentially other forms of language that can be just as insidious - would even allow people with different levels of skill as copy editors to focus where they can best be utilised, and it can even be used as a training aide for mentorship of rising copy editors.

And you know what, the theories are wrong!! Have they even tried to see if their theories are correct? NO. Unfortunately the search box in wikipedia is broken. Try searching for "currently". But if you use google https://www.google.co.nz/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+%22currently%22 ..... Try "last few years" and the result is the same ie LOTS of pages that could be improved, not many negative hits. Try "last few decades".

After they lose three points they lose their administration. # Fix the wikipedia search box so that if you use "" you get what you search for # Make a robot to flag (not change) time dependent words.  # Make a robot that saves me having to type tildas all the time for my signature.

The editor apparently wanted the statement to say something like "In 2012, everyone believes Y", which is a silly way of indicating a belief that has existed for decades, or "As of 2:57 a.m. GMT on January 3, 1953, when public opinion instantly and radically changed to something very different from the views in the Middle Ages, everyone now believes Y", which would have been wrong. ::I think there is a lot of room for improvement, but mindlessly flagging statements that are both accurate and verifiable because they might (or might not) need to be updated in another decade or two is not helpful.

If someone could get their hands on a New York Times or a LA Times or a Washington Post from December 14, 1990, they would find a review of Woody Interruptus.

That made me realize that we have a chronic problem on our hands.   So, how is the situation with out of date articles in fields such as life sciences, chemistry, medicine, etc.?   What I can tell you is that in the computer science project, many articles are embarrassingly outdated. I cleaned up supercomputer some time ago, and it was at least 10 years behind, if not more. Computer animation is at least 10 years behind, and I will clean it up by the end of summer probably - will be a rewrite. I came across [[Massively parallel]] now and it is at least 15 years behind, and still gives ESPRIT 1085 (1985) as an example. I will clean it up next week, but this seems to be a serious quality/reliability problem. I will not even attempt to look at all the computer networking articles in this lifetime - who knows how up to date they are?  What are people's experiences in fields such as chemistry, biology, medicine, etc.?  Now, contrast that with [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Can it go out of date within the next 5 years? Certainly not. The topic has been stable for centuries - Pythagoras is not proving theorems any more. Many of the math articles enjoy the "stable for ever" property. The same may be true of many art history articles, etc. Van Gogh and Rubens are not painting any more, of course.  Something needs to be done to mark the articles that may go out of date soon, to attract attention to them as "dynamic" topics that need attention once a year at least. As usual, the problem remains the shortage of editors. The last comment on [[Talk:Massively parallel]] was from June 2010 and they suggested a rename then, but no one seems to be even breathing there any more. The problem is that there are many far flung technical articles that are embarrassingly out of date and a list/category of some type may need to be invented for them. The current outdated tag means it is outdated now, not that it is likely to be ''chronically outdated'' unlike Van Gogh type articles.  I do not even know which articles me need ongoing attention. So some type of list/category should help identify the pages that need the most help on a routine basis. What is the best way to create this type of list/category to distinguish these from the timeless Pythagorean theorem type pages? [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 03:38, 22 May 2012 (UTC) :What ''specifically'' do you consider to be wrong with these articles?  Both could be improved but "out of date" would not be among my first criticisms.  I'm looking primarily at [[Integrated circuit packaging]] since I have little expertise in massively parallel systems but the content there seems pretty much up to date to me.  That there are few recent sources given does not make the material out of date: on the contrary, it reflects the speed of the underlying trends.  In my experience people tends to look at the speed at which new models and speed bumps come along and confuse that with the speed of progress in the fundamentals which is generally much slower.   :Since computers are being discussed here they are actually a good example - the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine|SSEM]] ran in 1948.  By 1960 the underlying theories for ''most'' of a current computer science degree were in place - most fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms (for example) were well known, operating systems and high level languages were in place.  By 1970 virtual memory, wide area networking, object orientation and multiprocessing had been added to the mix, and with semiconductor memory which was becoming widespread by that point the computers were very much beginning to look like they do now from a technical standpoint. :The popular computing press tends to cloud these fundamentals in endless reporting of yet another new product.  That's their job.  Out job is to be ''encyclopedic'', and take one step back and decide what is truly important for a thorough grounding.  Too many computer-related articles devolve into endless reporting of the latest products ([[Hard disk drive]] would be a good example) and neglect the fundamental broad-brush outline as a consequence.  :One final point: slapping issues templates on articles doesn't help anyone, particularly general ones as you have done to those articles.  The notes for those templates are clear that explanatory notes on the talk page describing the perceived problem should be left: without those no-one can fix the issue, and indeed no-one knows to remove the templates when the issus ''are'' fixed. Since there is no rationale anywhere I am removing those templates now, feel free to add them back ''with'' a rationale that is detailed enough to be acted upon.

[[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 15:47, 4 June 2012 (UTC)   === Chemistry ===  Sorry in advance for this wall of text about chemistry, but [[You Asked for It|since the door is open I'll give some thoughts]]; I'll section it so other fields can be separately seen. In the realm of chemical articles (not chemicals that are primarily of interest to medicine), very few articles are likely to become seriously outdated. Of the zillions (to us the technical term) of articles about specific chemicals, most are either niche chemicals that have little ongoing development or major industrial or common-experience chemicals that are well-established and at most might have a new application or properties discovered or become subject to some new regulation or study. But the facts likely don't change, just new chemical-articles created and more details added to old ones as someone has interest in them. Unlike advanced computer science or medicine, the study of chemicals doesn't generally "advance", and the articles aren't written from the perspective of tracking the latest [item or use] as a milestone except in certain small areas of active research. There are some sections of chemicals-articles content that do become dated, generally pertaining to current industrial trends (country or company producing the most; worldwide output or consumption; regulatory or environmental-impact concerns) and a very few chemicals derive their notability from being the "most X known" (latest in an ongoing development series, or an extreme of some chemical or physical property). I don't know enough about our current state of medicinal-chemical articles to know how much of their content is tied to their current medicinal status (either intrinsically or could-be-once-someone-adds-that-important-missing-info-to-them).  Another division of our chemistry articles is the set about specific reactions and about general structure-types (functional-groups) and details of them (types of bonds, aspects of stability). Some of these definitely do get dated because new reactions are often developed as extensions of old ones, long-ignored ones become popular by a new application or modification, or recent research into specific details becomes available. But most of these cases are dated by omission of recent work rather than becoming no-longer-correct over time. In at least some cases, the new material winds up in a new article forward/back-linked to the existing one because the new material is really a self-contained topic rather than just a more advanced bit of the old.  A third division might probably chemical-analysis (techniques and equipment, etc). Here is a place where things may well become dated and lose correctness. There really are advances in equipment and ways of doing experiments. While the theories-articles are fine (though perhaps not having the latest details added), the experimental applications do change (and not just by new ways being added with retention of the old ways in common use). For example, advances in materials and engineering make increasingly powerful types of lab instruments in a genre possible, and advances in signal handling migrate from analog to digital to more powerful computers with multidimensional numerical analysis, etc. [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] ([[User talk:DMacks|talk]]) 05:37, 22 May 2012 (UTC)  :Thank you for the analysis. So the way I understand it as a non-chemist is that the chemical structure of salt is not going to change next year, but the equipment for chemical analysis is likely to be dynamic, of course. And the chemical theories may change, but the basic concepts are likely to stay stable. Is that right? Now, how do you suggest "marking" the dynamic pages so they are distinguished from the very static pages?

[[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 09:29, 22 May 2012 (UTC)  As a counterpoint, there are newer and more dynamic fields which are more prone to articles becoming outdated.  Things like biophysics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology come to mind.  Synthetic chemistry, as DMacks explained, is a mature science where the core principles are known and are not likely to be changed.  New chemicals and reactions will continue to be discovered at the margins, but it is unlikely that there will be a discovery that will cause well-established articles to become outdated.  On the other hand, some articles in the more avant-garde fields will need to be updated more frequently, since in these fields the current state of the art may be completely superseded within a couple of years.  As far as the technical side, what would be our goal with such a system to mark dynamic pages?  Are we merely trying to encourage someone to review each of these articles every few years?  It seems that this is better done on the WikiProject level; perhaps there could be a category for "articles likely to become outdated", activated through an option on the WikiProject banner.  Perhaps such a category could be used to identify priority articles during a periodic WikiProject article improvement drive?  We could also think up a system which allows an editor to endorse articles as being up-to-date as of a specific date, again maybe through WikiProject banners, with older endorsements signaling a need for the article to be revisited.  Of course, the case needs to be made that there is a problem and that a proposed system solves it, to justify the extra bureaucratic overhead.

Its disadvantage is that the "Future" assessment precludes the use of a standard assessment, but if it could be changed to enable parallel use with a standard assessment, then it could be used for our purposes as well.

I would even suggest just a year, e.g. review this every year. The one thing I would really like to have is a list of when the articles in a Wikiproject are "due for oil change" also by importance. As is, the flags/assessments etc. can get spread all over the project and one forgets what needs to be updated. Ideally a user needs the dates when all the key articles need a review, then the mid-importance articles etc. But it looks like some solution is beginning to emerge here. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 06:10, 25 May 2012 (UTC)  == Quality-tracking system ==  My 6-years experience in wikipedias shows that we have not enough active users to watch all articles, such as that each article be watched by at least one active user. Hence, Wikipedia apparently has a lot of pending damage (pages which were improperly edited, or not yet edited after a degradation); see my new essay [[Wikipedia:Shoot it early]]. In future, the ratio of articles to editors become even higher and the problem become worse. I propose to consider an approach opposite to "Flagged revisions". Namely, to store some data (including a pointer to revision) about each ''section'' of each ''article'', instead of storing some data about ''each revision''.  The proposed system should be able: * To have several degrees of quality, such as perfect&nbsp;(5), fine&nbsp;(4), doubtful/controversial&nbsp;(3), unsourced&nbsp;(2), ungrammatical/unformatted&nbsp;(1), unchecked/raw&nbsp;(0). * To track renaming and rearranging of sections, at least for most edits. This is probably the most difficult technically. * To have a set of records (quality,&nbsp;revision,&nbsp;expert) for each section, which should point to major improvements (including creation) of the section. "Expert" should be any registered user, unless this privilege was explicitly denied. * To provide possibility of adding such records both for ongoing edits (for which expert&nbsp;=&nbsp;author) and retrospectively. Any "expert" (see the previous item) should be able to add a record or to upgrade its "quality" value. * To raise an alert (such as highly visible mark in watchlist and the edit history) if a section previously rated at&nbsp;least&nbsp;(3) disappeared without explanations. * To allow altering (downgrading and deleting) there records to people with the "reviewer" privilege (shared with FlaggedRevs). * By customization, to display, below or near the section's header, a coloured bar (corresponding to registered quality) and links to several of recently registered revisions. The latter is the thing which can ultimately make the system useful for tracking casual degradations.  What is wrong with [[WP: Flagged revisions]]? Let a reviewer to spot some edit. It has then three easy options. If s/he marks the edit as reviewed, then s/he virtually become responsible for it, although s/he may not be an expert in this particular matter. Reverting an edit is also a responsibility, and may constitute a newcomer's biting or provoke an edit war. If s/he choose to do nothing, it will increase the backlog of unchecked edits which will gradually weaken the entire system.  Instead, the proposed system prompts to check edits not on the spot, but when someone reads (and especially intends to do something with), say, a particular section. If a user sees <span style="background-color:#00FF00">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</span> near the header, but the section is poor, it can mean that either the section was degraded since the last evaluation (which can easily be checked against aforementioned links to old revisions) or someone abused the "expert" feature (which may be deterred administratively). In the opposite case, if a reader feels that a section is underestimated, it may upgrade the "quality" field. Also, we may introduce a special (negative) "warning" quality level, to indicate that "expert" is actually not an expert, but feels that the so-labeled edit is problematical.  Although such system is very complex, it possibly will be more resistant to misinformation than FlaggedRevs, and will be much more convenient than searching the history for any doubtful stuff. [[User:Incnis Mrsi|Incnis Mrsi]] ([[User talk:Incnis Mrsi|talk]]) 16:29, 2 June 2012 (UTC)  : Yes, this system looks very complex, hard to use and implement. And if you make it a little less automatic, you will get simple tags (like "<nowiki>{{unreferenced}}</nowiki>" or "<nowiki>{{POV}}</nowiki>"). However, the actual system of tags seems to be far more flexible, able to show more than one problem. : In the end, if the matter is of any importance, the reader ''must'' check everything he reads on Wikipedia. There are no workarounds for that. We can help this process by giving the reader sources, showing the edit history and talk page, but we should do nothing that could give the reader the idea that the text is "reliable" and nothing has to be done. --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 21:09, 2 June 2012 (UTC) ::The problem of the declining user:article ratio is definitely a concern and something that will have to be dealt with in the future.

In the real world only experts should (but not "must") check, and fix, all they are reading. That's why "tags" actually are very important, but currently not accountable for.

This would be for trusted users who are so unlikely to vandalize that their edits should not be replaced through automation. A manual edit to remove their inclusions would always be possible but only administrators could roll them back. This would solve a couple problems. It would promote discussion of the edit because when the rollbacker attempted the rollback they would instead see a message stating something to the effect "This is a trusted user who is exempt from rollback. To modify their edit you must manually append a revision or request an administrator perform the automated procedure. It is highly probable that discussion is the most appropriate next step." and it would quell the current form of edit war common with vandals who restore their own edit right after being rolled back, in continuous cycle until they are blocked.

A rollback edit war is rare, because the sort of vandals who will repeatedly restore an unwanted edit generally do not have access to rollback, or any of the various similar tools.  All the edits at [[Miami cannibal attack]] given as an example above are manual edits, and that is the common pattern for edit wars.  Disabling the potential for rollback/automated-reversion for any of those edits wouldn't have altered the course of events.  Preventing ''all'' reversion to a given article text is effectively enshrining the 1-revert-rule, which is not in line with current policy (nor, I think, would it be a good idea).

Who said [[Watson (computer)|machines]] [[DBpedia|aren't]] [[Machine learning|learning]] from us, too? For example, the entire navbar as well as catlinks box could be placed in <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags. ; [[WP:MOS|Encourage editors]] to use appropriate tags for emphasis rather than just bold or italic. : According to the W3C, <code>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code> tags should be used rather than italics when emphasizing text (if you're going to use italics to do so), and plain italics (<code><nowiki>''Italic book or mag title''</nowiki></code>) for everything else that gets italicized. No human will ever notice the difference, but remember what I was saying about machines reading and using Wikipedia as well? ; Use inline [[MathML]] and [[SVG]]. : These features are appropriate for an online encyclopedia and could replace the current standard of PNG equations, depending on your preferences.

It cannot limit itself to fiction, and notability of fiction itself is... vague to define nowadays, as [[WP:notability (fiction)]] is an essay.

Recaps of programs (fictional plot or event summary) may have been mistaken for evidence of notability, so, even if one might pass GNG, the show might fail such criteria of inclusion or exclusion, or the other way around... Also, the awards might or might not prove notability, but look at [[Woody Interruptus]]: it won the Best Director award that has nothing to do with the plot itself, and there is no commentary about or awards contributed by the plot. Even ratings don't help much. [[Access Hollywood]] and seasons of [[Survivor (TV series)]]... do they pass GNG? If so, how? Amount of episodes and episodes themselves... must they be proof of notability? [[KDOC]] could be notable because of news coverage about this station and its background, but... that's all I can say, unless it fails GNG. :: The '''second question''': amount of television topics is diversive, regardless of what television and radio stations have in common. Television and radio are different from each other; you hear people talking or singing in radio; you see and hear things in television. Look at [[WP:notability (people)]]; it is diversive with human beings, yet they have nothing in common, unless I'm wrong. However, if television stations must be excluded from the guidelines, then how can I disambiguate "television"?

Thus it is not clear if that is "significant coverage", but I guess that notability is demonstrated by having someone giving an effort to collect the data and publish it in a serious publication. And we know that members of such legislatures do get such attention, thus we can make a more specific guideline (or just apply [[WP:IAR]], for we do have a reason). Now, maybe you can give an example of a TV program for which a similar case can be made (notability or lack of it could be clearly demonstrated to almost anyone - inclusionist or deletionist - but the general guideline would give a different - or borderline - answer)? Or maybe you can show that there are some "shortcuts" - conditions that would be easy to check and would indicate presence of coverage in suitable sources?

But you should be more precise: what sort of "impact"? Did the show inspire most of its viewers to start some sort of regime change right after the premiere? If it did, it would be easy to persuade everyone that it was notable. But then, we would need sources to show that it did, and the program would be notable by the general guideline as well... And, well, I don't think you had such impact in mind... So, what exactly did you mean? ::::: And the number of episodes doesn't seem to be an obvious indicator of notability. It doesn't even seem hard to make a show with many episodes, if there are no requirements for quality... ::::: There is one more thing you might wish to try: make a list of deletion discussions that, er, had some problems now and would have had less if there was a guideline you propose. Then, for each of them, explain why do you think so. ::::: And finally, there is some danger that, unless we have enough good sources about something (thus proving that we deal with the object that is notable according to the general guideline), we won't be able to write an article worth reading (and keeping)...

I saw a fundraising banner a day or so ago. Was it just my imagination or are they doing fundraising more than once a year now?  As you recall we talked about [[Right time marketing]] a few months ago. I saw the banner once, and it had a picture of Jimmy Wales and a request for funds. But that was it. It was not repeated. If they are experimenting with that I think they should not just place the banner once at random. That will get minimal results and may cause them to abandon that approach. A user typically needs to see the banner 3-7 times to respond. Once is never enough. That requires that registered users be targeted first and a count is kept of how many times they have seen the banner. The key to that type of message is repetition, but not over-repetition.   So, if they are placing fundraising banners somewhat at random, do talk them into doing them at least 3 times (but 5 is preferred) for registered users, if they are to be effective. And please do say that the results of a random placement experiment can not be relied upon. Repetition, and right time marketing are essential for the success of this experiment.  Please let me know. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 21:52, 14 June 2012 (UTC) :You came across a banner test.  The fundraising team runs them (for an hour at a time) every now and then throughout the year.  Mostly they are doing A/B tests on things like language or form performance.

I know there is $20M in the bank, but if things go south they will wish they had $40M. 12 months is a long time to wait for new funds. I think they can get 25% to 35% more by fundraising throughout the year by right time marketing. I would have paid again if they had hit me the right way.

Not stopping to read a message is not an excuse for continuing spaming, but I think this is a problem in that it would be better to make the user additionally aware that there is some more urgent going on than someone merely trying to send them a message so that the user more likely stops to see what that might be. To address this, perhaps the background color of the User talk notification can be tied to (1) the [[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace]] being posted and (2) the permission of the editor posting the user warning. In other words, if an admin posted a series of user warnings like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.77.177.189&oldid=484899014 these], the color of the User talk notification should change to match the escalating warnings, with the last "You have new messages" notification background being red.

As an example article, take a look at this: [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)]]  The first three sentences are a really nice lead.  There are suitable links to other articles.  But imagine a user who has no familiarity with the subject - inserting a first sentence saying that this is a computer CPU would help.  As it stands users might not be sure whether this item is a CPU or GPU or some other IC used in computing.  Compare with any article about a US president. The first line says "$PERSON was blah blah blah and Xth president of the United States beween $YEAR_START and $YEAR_END"  There are some problems with this.  * Simple English is very hard to write well.  Simple English about technical subjects is harder to write. * Being correct (using "useful lies") is troublesome for an encyclopaedia.  Often a simple English description might use language which is truthful but not fully pedantically rigorously correct.  I think this is okay, so long as the lead acknowledges the short-comings.  --[[Special:Contributions/31.126.231.18|31.126.231.18]] ([[User talk:31.126.231.18|talk]]) 22:26, 16 June 2012 (UTC) :We have a Simple English Wikipedia.

Still, to expect it to briefly explain a CPU is too much - that might be feasible for such a short article, but other articles cover such a wide scope that it's already difficult to summarize everything in four paragraphs. Simple English Wikipedia might not develop fast enough to address the issue, so it's a good thing we have wikilinks. The reader can go from Ivy Bridge to CPU, and then from CPU to computer and so on. There are too many subpar leads, though. Maybe we could implement some interface for systemically going through leads and improving them. You don't need knowledge of the subject to do that, only writing skills. I think improving all leads would greatly enhance the reader's experience, because when the lead summarizes the article properly, that's all the information most readers are looking for. <span style="text-shadow:#FFFF66 0.7px 0.7px 0.7px; class=texhtml">[[user:Junglejill|<font color="#669900">''ʝungle''</font>]][[User_talk:Junglejill|<font color="009900">''jill''</font>]]</span> 23:04, 17 June 2012 (UTC)  This is a great suggestion, imo, but I don't know how we can action this on a community-level.

I'd think that the obvious solution would be to add Category search to basic search.  Then searching Wikipedia for an article "ABCDEF" would very probably find a Category "ABCDEF" containing an article on "ABCDEF" but under a different name.

I hope it's not too discouraging in your case. Regarding article titles, I'm really not an expert on our polices and I don't really know if we have something to cover the best way to determine what an article title should be. I will say in general, if there's no guideline for something people will often create an essay (per [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia essays]]) and ask for input from the community. Then they'll propose that the essay become a guideline (per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Life cycle]]). This usually happens when somebody, such as yourself, see a need to clarify something. Wikipedia is quite chaotic in how it develops and it might be possible nobody has thought about this issue and that you are the expert in this area.

The best research method depends on the field (e.g., web search results are good for software, but weak for medicine).  The best title depends on your [[personal and cultural values]].  For example, we have some people who firmly believe that the best possible title for an article about a person is always the person's full, legal name ("William Jefferson Clinton").  We also have people who believe that the best title uses initials for the first name ("S. R. Rana").  We also have people who believe that academic titles ought to be included ("Prof. Richard Dawkins").  None of these personal and cultural preferences are "right" or "wrong".  We can easily find reliable sources that back up each of them, because our sources have personal and cultural preferences, too.  We already provide advice on what the community most commonly chooses in such situations, but there are times when we reject the common approach and choose another.  There is no single answer.  There is no single criterion that always trumps the others.

I am suggesting that Wikipedia objectives should be (1) to help the average user research what is available, (2) to make it easier for the user to find Wikipedia guidelines, (3) to better promote the advantages of creating user and talk pages — "an alias is OK".   ::: As examples of problems with the current Wikipedia basic search interface / ways that it could be improved:  :::(1) (a) Instead of saying just "You may create the page "ABCDEF"..." as described in the scenario above, ::::also provide a clickable link like "'''Search for "ABCDEF" in Categories.'''" (This is needed because basic Wikipedia search does not search categories, and many or most experienced users don't know how to search categories—you need to know how to find Advanced search). This would help authors of new articles choose article names and category names that are reasonably consistent. Given the importance of Category search, and the fact that few people can work out how to do it, surely it would make a lot of sense to alias the Category search button up one level (to the same level as the Advanced search button) in the box below the [[Special:search|Special search]] box so that one doesn't have to know to click on the Advanced search button in order to find Category search?

Where we have a problem is with articles on Coach, Fry, and Apu, where the common name is ''not'' unambiguous.

(It is absolutely critical that a guideline not give advice that conflicts with a policy. In rare cases, we might decide that the guideline is valid, and seek to modify the policy, but in most cases, we would modify the guideline to make sure it is in line with policy.)  You are proposing a guideline about the naming of fictional characters, and some are noting that we already have a policy on naming items.  So the obvious questions: * Is your guideline consistent with the policy? If not, something has to give. * Does the existing policy already provide sufficient guidance, in which case the guideline isn't needed * If the policy doesn't provide sufficient guidance, should the policy be amended, or a guideline be written?

For example, a reliable and well-respected textbook is not necessarily considered notable on Wikipedia. Such articles may be put up for deletion, which can be frustrating for newcomers. :* We have strict provisions against copyright infringement and the use of original research. Professors and researchers should probably be made aware of the latter. :* It could mention the guidelines provided by the Manual of Style, which create a definite learning curve. :* Of the five pillars, the one that wasn't covered was civility. Even experienced editors can sometimes be a little unpleasant to deal with. : I'm sure you're probably already familiar with these points, but you did ask for feedback so I thought I'd mention some topical concerns that seemed noticeable by their absence.

The issue of wanting the coordinates to show up in handheld applications is an interesting one (albeit not one that should determine [[WP:Notability]]).  This was the first time I had seen this raised in a Wikipedia discussion, but I see that it also arose lst year in [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 89#Notability of cemeteries|this Village Pump (policy) discussion]], also about cemeteries.  Since many individual items that are geolocatable and could be of interest to a person with a handheld device are typically covered in broader articles, there is likely to be increasing demand for a way to broadcast multiple geolocations associated with a single Wikipedia article. It is something that would be needed for most all Wikimedia projects. Is anybody aware of, or working on, a link/redirect function that could include (and broadcast) the geolocation data for multiple elements in a single article? Is this feasible? --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 20:05, 17 July 2012 (UTC) : Does it work to put the geolocation data on the redirects to the merged article?

I have not investigated this. --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 19:24, 18 July 2012 (UTC) ::: That's clearly false. You just put the appropriate template (or other markup) on the redirect page. The question is whether the tools people use will find it or ignore it. [[User:Anomie|Anomie]][[User talk:Anomie|⚔]] 19:55, 18 July 2012 (UTC) ::::My point was not whether or not one can put wiki markup on a redirect, but my point was that putting geocoordinates in a redirect was silly. The original [[NRHP]] discussion had to do with combining articles on geolocated objects, such as [[Cuyuna Iron Range Municipally-Owned Elevated Metal Water Tanks|these 3 objects that are in a 10K range of each other]]. Currently that article is geolocated to the middle of the three objects. Are coordinates in redirects of the other two sites supposed to overwrite the coordinates on the destination page? What's wrong with creating two more articles? My remark has to do with being able to find wikipedia articles with Google. I put the link in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Boniface Cemetery, Wrought-Iron Cross Site|the AfD proposal]], but here it is again: Please see [http://support.google.com/maps/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=144359 this link] for information on how to view Wikipedia articles based on geocoordinates in Google maps. I am baffled simply by the idea of putting geocoordinates in redirects - I would prefer a stub with a link back to the destination article. What I find odd about even discussing this is that I had no idea people could be so against the idea of stub creation on principle. I make stubs all the time, and I think they're great. I have seen stubs I created back in 2009 grow in all sorts of interesting ways, based on input from other Wikipedians. [[User:Jane023|Jane]] ([[User talk:Jane023|talk]]) 05:09, 19 July 2012 (UTC) ::::: It seems to me that putting coordinate data on a redirect makes as much sense as [[Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects|putting a category on a redirect instead of on the target article]]: sometimes it's not useful, but sometimes it is. For example, we want [[:Category:Fictional birds]] to contain [[The Road Runner]] rather than [[Wile E.

[[User:Anomie|Anomie]][[User talk:Anomie|⚔]] 18:39, 19 July 2012 (UTC)  == Searching for deleted files ==  As an OTRS agent, I often get inquiries where the writer does not specify the exact article name or image name. With a little fishing, I can often figure it out. For example, if the writer is "Joe Jones", using the search will identify a number of possibilities.  However, it is quite common for them to be inquiring about a deleted article. If they have the exact article name, I can find it, but if it is not exact, I cannot. On several occasions, I have made a guess, failed to find it, and when we tracked it down, the right title was very close, sometimes only a single character different, such as an apostrophe or some other minor character.  My suggestion is simple to state, although I have no idea how hard it would be in practice:  Admins have the authority to view deleted material. If the search results could detect that an admin was making the request, and expand the search options to included deleted material, it would make it much easier to find the article name, and not have to engage in back and forth by email to track down the article.  If it is not easy for the search box to identify who is making the search, an alternative would be a search screen only accessible to admins.  As an example, suppose the author of 1970-71 Mitropa Cup writes to me and provides permission. I need to find the article and undelete it. If I copy the correct name into a search box, it won't find it, but it will suggest I create it, and when I click on it, there will be an option to undelete it. Or I can enter the name in the deletion log and see it. However, if the person writing to me says the article name is 1970-71 Mitropa Cup (using a hyphen instead of an en-dash) the search function won't find it, nor will a search of a deletion log. Those searches only get hits with exact names. I'd like the ability for admins to search, and even if it doesn't find the exact match it should show deleted names that are close to the entered name.   I assume this will only work if we index the deleted names as well.  If I know the editor's name, I can search their contributions, but editors usually write to OTRS using  their real names, and only occasionally include their user names, plus, it is quite common for the person contacting us to be someone other than the editor.    I'm starting at Idea Lab rather than Proposals, because it occurs to me that there may be other ways to accomplish my goal, or other things I need to consider before writing this up as a formal proposal.--[[User:Sphilbrick|<span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">SPhilbrick</span>]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|<span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span>]] 22:03, 20 July 2012 (UTC) :Addendum: It was suggested I check Bugzilla, to see if this has been discussed.

Generally when an editor wikilinks a term in articlespace, a redlink will indicate if they did something wrong. Unprintworthy redirects deny the editor this feedback, so if I add a sentence to an article and link [[Tom Hank]] for example, I would see a blue link when I preview my changes, which simply redirects to the correct title, [[Tom Hanks]]. Now I'm rather unfamiliar with most editing bots that run on Wikipedia, but last I recall there seemed to generally be more willing programmers than viable bot purposes. Perhaps there is a bot doing this already, though I could see it being difficult for a bot to choose which print-worthy redirect to replace each typo with... *So I ask, is there a system in place to catch this type of error?

This is somewhat like the fact that admins block at their own discretion in many situations. The new userright would be created using [[:mw:Manual:$wgRevokePermissions]] on the technical level.

I know truth is dependent on  point of view, but facts are always facts.  And so much of what is on Wikipedia  is not  fact nor truth.   That is why so many schools & universities will not allow anything quoted from Wikipedia which is sad.  The greatest learning tool of this age and it is disallowed across the board by so many because there is no accountability.  Just like the politicians and popstars that scrub out certain facts from their wiki file because they are shady or do not paint them in a good  light and so much more pushed into their wiki file that is either false  or frivilious.   There has to be a editorial tool/computer program that can help make the job of managing the content and info in wiki better.  If there is not then that is what I need to work on I guess.  I'm a history major in college and know the difference between truth, fact, and opinion. And i want to help, if possible, get Wikipedia's  credibility back.

I think (and it has been shown very well) that deletion discussions, particularly speedy deletions and snowball discussions, are one of the most inhospitable environments to subject a newbie to. All too often the first article somebody creates is nominated for deletion or speedy deletion. Hell, even [[Karmakanic|my first article]] when I got serious with Wikipedia was nominated and nearly vanquished to the pits of doom. For many, it spells the end of their attempt to continue.  I think its fair to say a lot of us came to Wikipedia with a "conflict of interest" - There was something in particular we wanted to work on, and from there the story grows. I think it's important that we prevent potential editors from being scared away, and I believe XfD, specifically AfD, is the largest beast to slay in this regard. There are a few suggestions I think would jump start a transition.  There are two types of nominations at AfD that I see. The first type is new articles; the second is reoccuring nominations. The system works well for the latter type, but fails miserably with the first. Could the two be separated as a process? Perhaps if they could, the new article nominations could be set up under a process where nominations must be made using one or more of a list of predefined reasons, thereby eliminating the nominators personal opinion and making the process procedural. The snowball/pile on effect is also disheartening to new editors, and so this separated process could also possibly protect against that.  In both processes, perhaps not allowing voting for the first 48 hours would encourage editors to take time investigating the noteworthiness of the topic under review, rather than voting with their opinion or without investigating sources on the net.   I know one of the issues with watering down the way users can vote is that "we don't vote", we go by reasoning and arguments. By blocking out the reasoning it would literally become a vote. So perhaps the exact opposite would work: No voting, just reasoning as to the notability of the topic. The closing admin would determine the outcome. However, the issue here is that even prohibiting voting as it were would only hide the '''keep''', '''delete''' and '''merge''' bolding. Could we do 'blind' voting, where usernames are hidden until the vote is closed and only the comment is visible to users, thereby preventing voting by association, or cabalism.  I think it's clear that a reform is needed. Perhaps my ideas are non-starters, or they might encourage some others or some brainstorming. However, the problem has been acknowledged for quite some time, so let's do something about it!  - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 15:21, 14 July 2012 (UTC) : I agree that AfD can be an inhospitable environment, but that's mainly because of a collision between conflicting interests. There's bound to be some contention and politicization of the process. Civility among both the nominators and the respondents is frequently helpful in resolving the discussion in a useful manner. It's unclear what a 48 hour delay would do to ease the situation; that just increases the amount of time one has to spend on what is already a big time sink.

The claims that good newbies are often scared by deletion of their articles are sure common. But let's look from the other side. We tell the newbies "Be bold!" (as in [[Wikipedia:Be bold]]). We also tell them that they can be bold because their sincere mistakes can cause no lasting harm: bad edits will be reverted and - yes - bad articles will be deleted. We hear about the newbies that do not like deletion of their first article, because they complain, but are we sure there are no newbies (and, may I say, ''better'' newbies) who have looked at the deletion of their article with joy? I don't think that many of them should be expected to say anything, but it doesn't mean that they do not exist. : There is a second point. We don't need "more editors". We need more ''good'' editors. And "good" first of all means "taking criticism well", including the harsh criticism - although one should not confuse "harsh" with "impolite" or "insulting". Thus the editors we want can be expect to react to the proposal to delete their article rather well.

The process isn't perfect, but it seems to be better than nothing. : That brings me to the third point: is there some evidence that the criticism of the articles often happens to be impolite or insulting?

One of the inherent problems of AfD (like in many other places) is that anyone can !vote. Having participated on  close on 1,000 AfDs and closed many, I get a distinct impression that much  of the !voting is subjective. Perhaps a guideline that  all  !votes, whether keep, oppose, merge, etc should ''all'' be backed up by citing policies and established guidelines would lead to more consistent and more objective !voting.   Recent assurances have been given by the WMF that they are now 'revisiting'  a proposal they  made over a year go  that has remained dormant since, to create a new landing page for new users. The new landing page (working title  [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Article_Creation_Workflow Article Creation Work Flow]) would probably replace the Article Creation Wizard, and might possibly  be developed as an obligatory step for new users towards the creation of their new pages. This may significantly reduce the number of CSD, PROD, and AfD.

[[User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing]] ([[User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk]]) 01:16, 1 August 2012 (UTC)  : Personally I don't see much point in having separate A and GA classes. There's little motivation in working for an A, when GA is just as satisfactory and with a little more work the article may gain an FA. A-class is essentially a redundant criteria, and it almost feels like you're losing status by trying to take it from GA class to A class. Perhaps if the FAC could also be used to assess whether an article satisfies the A criteria... but I think that idea has been discussed before.  : That being said, I think what really needs to be clarified is what exactly allows an article to clear the A bar without satisfying the FA criteria.

As far as A class goes, It has been completely supplanted by GA.  That classification is dead, save for the military history project.  There really isn't enough of a gap between B and GA or GA and FA to make A class useful again. This proposal is well considered, but unnecessary.

Almost any article on a company has someone on the other end wondering if they should edit it. Add a template on company pages or just on their Talk pages, perhaps through the Wikiproject Companies template, cautioning about COI and encouraging COIs to use <nowiki>{{request edit}}</nowiki> or a link to some other instructions. So that any company that views the Talk page on their own articles can get some guidance on what to do and what not to do. # Write a letter written by the community that can be sent to PR agencies and departments. Create more dialogue between the PR and Wikipedia communities. The letter might provide some guidance on what kinds of edits are universally acceptable, what universally isn't and where there's a grey area. # By and large, media humiliation has prevented the Fortune 500 from grossly unethical behavior on Wikipedia, but leaving this power in the hands of reporters, instead of with the Wikipedia community, has its shortcomings. Creating our own wall of shame, owned and operated by the community, but shared with the media, would do a better job discouraging a broader range of behavior we all agree is improper, while not shaming people who don't necessarily deserve it. It's impossible for us to play a game of wack-a-mole to try to prevent censorship and spam on Wikipedia, instead of deterring those edits from ever occurring in the first place, by letting people know their actions will be exposed (we would use examples where we couldn't remotely maintain AGF). This would be through a very careful and rigorous process.

Not a bad idea, in any event. *# I'm uncomfortable with this idea. Our ethos has always been to punish only preventatively, not punitively.

It was named by [[Martin Fowler]] in his 2003 book ''Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=Martin |title=Patterns of enterprise application architecture |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-321-12742-6 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FyWZt5DdvFkC&lpg=PA1&dq=Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture%20by%20Martin%20Fowler&pg=PT187#v=onepage&q=active%20record&f=false }}</ref> The interface of an object conforming to this pattern would include functions such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete, that operate on objects that represent domain entity types in a data store.  A Data Mapper is a [[Data access layer|Data Access Layer]] that performs bidirectional transfer of data between a persistent data store (often a [[relational database]]) and an in memory data representation (the domain layer). The goal of the pattern is to keep the in memory representation and the persistent data store independent of each other and the data mapper itself. The layer is composed of one or more mappers (or [[Data Access Object]]s), performing the data transfer. Mapper implementations vary in scope. Generic mappers will handle many different domain entity types, dedicated mappers will handle one or a few.  == Implementations == Implementations of the concept can be found in various [[Software framework|frameworks]] for many programming environments.  === Java/.Net === * [[MyBatis]] persistence framework  === PHP === * [[Doctrine (PHP)|Doctrine2]] Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and the Database Abstraction Layer<ref name="Doctorine2">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/your-own-orm-doctrine2.html#doctrine2-and-activerecord|title=Doctrine2 and ActiveRecord{{spaced ndash |archiveurl=http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/your-own-orm-doctrine2.html#doctrine2-and-activerecord}} Doctrine2|publisher=[[Doctrine (PHP)|Doctrine2]]}}</ref>  === Python === * [[SQLAlchemy]] library  === Ruby === * [https://github.com/jgaskins/perpetuity Perpetuity] * [http://rom-rb.org/ Ruby Object Mapper (ROM)], known as [[DataMapper|DataMapper 2]] during development  === Scala === * [http://code.google.com/p/orbroker/ orbroker]  === JavaScript === * [http://bookshelfjs.org/ Bookshelf.js]  == See also == * [[Data access layer]] * [[Data Access Object]] * [[Active record pattern]] * [[Object relational mapping]]  == References == {{Reflist}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Data mapper pattern}} [[Category:Software design patterns]]</text></page>",
